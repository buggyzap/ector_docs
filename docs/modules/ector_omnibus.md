# Ector Omnibus

The Ector Omnibus Module introduces an innovative price tracking functionality to your Prestashop e-commerce website. This module revolutionizes how you display product prices and promotions to your customers while ensuring compliance with the Omnibus Directive's guidelines. With the Ector Omnibus Module, every price change for products is meticulously recorded in your database.
