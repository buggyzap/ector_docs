# Ector Wishlist

The Ector Wishlist Module enhances the customer experience on your Prestashop website by providing a user-friendly and convenient way to create and manage wishlists. This module simplifies the process of adding products to a wishlist, ensuring that only logged-in customers can utilize this feature. Customers can easily add products to their wishlist directly from the product page using a "wishlist" button. The wishlist can then be viewed and managed from a dedicated listing page within the customer's account. Additionally, a menu link allows customers to quickly access their wishlist.

## Key Features

### 1. Wishlist Creation

Customers can create and manage wishlists effortlessly, allowing them to curate a list of desired products for future purchase. The process is intuitive and streamlined to enhance the overall shopping experience.

### 2. Secure Access

To maintain security and privacy, only logged-in customers have the ability to add products to their wishlist. If a non-logged-in user attempts to add a product, a popup prompt encourages them to log in or create an account to access the wishlist feature.

### 3. Product Addition

Customers can add products to their wishlist directly from the product page by clicking the "wishlist" button associated with each product. This simplifies the process of saving items for later consideration.

### 4. Wishlist Listing

A dedicated listing page within the customer's account displays all the products they've added to their wishlist. This provides customers with an organized and accessible view of their desired items.

### 5. Quick Access

For added convenience, a menu link is provided, allowing customers to easily access their wishlist from any page on the website. This ensures that customers can review and manage their wishlist whenever they desire.
