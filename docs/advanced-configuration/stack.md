# Introduction to Stack

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the technology stack utilized in the Ector theme. Understanding the underlying technologies is essential for web agencies working with the Ector theme, as it sets the foundation for efficient development and optimized website performance.

## Technologies at the Core

The Ector theme leverages a combination of modern technologies and libraries to deliver exceptional performance and a smooth user experience. Here are the key technologies at the core of the Ector theme:

### 1. **AlpineJS Library**

   - **Promoting AlpineJS**: The Ector theme utilizes the AlpineJS library extensively and promotes its use for front-end development.
   - **Alpine.store State**: AlpineJS facilitates state management through Alpine.store, allowing developers to create reactive components that respond dynamically to changes in data.
   
### 2. **Tailwind CSS**

   - **Lightweight Styling**: Tailwind CSS is the primary styling framework used in the Ector theme. Its utility-first approach enables the creation of efficient and lightweight CSS.
   - **Minimal CSS Payload**: Thanks to Tailwind CSS, the CSS payload of the Ector theme remains exceptionally small, averaging around 15KB. This ensures fast loading times and optimal website performance.

### 3. **ESBuild**

   - **JavaScript Optimization**: The Ector theme optimizes JavaScript delivery through ESBuild, a JavaScript bundler and minifier. This results in reduced file sizes and faster loading of JavaScript assets.
   - **NPM Build Processes**: The theme's development process is integrated with specific NPM build processes, ensuring efficient management and delivery of JavaScript resources.

### 4. **WebSocket**

   - **Live Reload**: The Ector theme includes WebSocket functionality, enabling live reload of changes during development. This feature streamlines the development process, allowing developers to see updates in real-time.

### 5. **jQuery**

:::caution

While jQuery is present in the Ector theme due to external module dependencies and to keep backward compatibility, we do not actively promote its use. Developers are encouraged to leverage more modern alternatives, such as AlpineJS, whenever possible.
